- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gagallango

I can describe myself as a very outgoing person with a strong desire to keep learning about programming.

It all started many years ago, when I saw my mother in front of a computer with a black screen and green letters. I always wanted to know what she was doing and how it worked, but above all, I wanted to be a computer scientist like her.

At the age of 22, and having completed my Journalism degree, I realized that I could develop myself within programming (I was already working as a content manager, so it was a familiar field because I was already playing with some webs), where I could also use my most creative side. This is how, for almost 5 years, I've been trying to grow as a professional in the world of development, facing challenges that I would not know I could overcome and learning day by day from the best professionals and incredible projects.

I consider myself a very outgoing person with a strong desire to keep learning.
